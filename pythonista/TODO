* legend-style stack display

  * slices for strings
  * pointer name resolution
  * color coded

* more streamlined user interface (we can scratch
  the prompt, and maybe other elements, and focus on
  the resulting stack more)

* code export

  * markdown
  * raw text
  * to gist
  * to clipboard

# Contributing

We are using the services of Launchpad to manage the repositories and bug
tracking. While not mandatory, it is recommended that you create a Launchpad
account if you plan to contribute to the main repository.

# Bug Reports

Bugs can be reported by email crc@forthworks.com.

# Bazaar

We are using the Bazaar version control (bzr). You can make a branch, and
we can merge it into the main repository as necessary.

* Create a Launchpad account

* Register an SSH key

Then:

    bzr branch lp:parable

In your branch, make changes and commit:

    bzr add <files>
    bzr status
    bzr commit -m "commit message"

I recommend using bzr status to check exactly which files are being committed.

And push to a new branch:

    bzr push lp:~<username>/parable/<branchname>

Replace <username> and <branchname> with your Launchpad account name and the
name of your branch. Once this is done, future bzr push invocations should
use the specified branch by default.

When you're ready for me to merge, file a merge request on Launchpad, or send
me an email.

# Patches

If you can not use Bazaar and Launchpad, you can email patches (or modified
files and instructions) to crc@forthworks.com. Note that patches will take
longer to merge into the main repository.

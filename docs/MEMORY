# Memory Model

Parable has a highly segmented memory model.

## General Layout

Memory is organized into a series of *slices*. There are a fixed number
of slices, each of which is a consistent length. The current defaults
are:

        MAX_SLICES = 64000
        SLICE_LEN = 1000

Slices contain a linear sequence of numeric values. All compiled byte
code, strings, and other data are stored in slices.

## Access

Each memory location within a slice is accessed via a pointer and offset
pair. Both the pointer and the offset are zero based, and run in a strict
linear order.

An example implementation in Python:

        p_slices = []

        def fetch(slice, offset):
            global p_slices
            return p_slices[int(slice)][int(offset)]

        def store(value, slice, offset):
            global p_slices
            p_slices[int(slice)] = value


        # fetch the first value in slice 0
        fetch(0, 0)

        # fetch the second value in slice 0
        fetch(0, 1)

Parable uses floating point values. These are restricted to integers when
accessing slices and offsets.

Within Parable, use the *fetch* and *store* functions to access values in
slices:

        #0 #0 fetch        "get first value in slice 0"
        #0 #1 fetch        "get second value in slice 0"
        #9 #1000 #3 store  "set fourth value of slice 1000 to 9"

## Allocations

Parable maintains a map of allocated slices. When a new slice is requested,
the next unused slice is marked as occupied and a pointer to it is returned.

The list is scanned each time an allocation is requested, and the first free
slot is allocated and returned.

When a slice is released, the map position corresponding to it is marked as
free.

Allocation should reset the slice to an empty state.

## Garbage Collection

A very limited form of garbage collection is provided.

The system can scan all named slices, and build a list of all values
stored in those slices. This is sorted, and all duplicates removed.
Any values not in this list are assumed to be garbage, and can then
be collected.

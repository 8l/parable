This directory contains the CGI Endpoints for Parable as a Service

0 - main interface
0.ld - w/multi-line definition support (requires a blank line between functions)
0.st - w/syntax tweaks (numbers without # prefix)
0.ld.st - 0.ld + 0.st

Each of these has a .low mode as well which reduces memory consumption and gives a
smaller response set.

# Setup

Copy (or symlink) bootstrap.p and parable.py into the directory with these files.

Call with a "code" parameter set to the code you want to run. Response set will be
in JSON format.

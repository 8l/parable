This is Parable, a small programming language.

It is stack based and concatenative in nature. It has a trivial syntax
(whitespace delimited tokens, with single character prefixes that guide
the compiler), a dictionary mapping names to functions and data elements,
and support for a few simple data types (numbers, characters, strings,
flags, and pointers)

In implementing this, I have left out any form of I/O. The byte codes
and interpreter can be easily modified to allow for I/O functionality
that your applications may need.

=========================================================================

# parable.php

This contains the core language (compiler, byte code interpreter), but no
user interface code.


=========================================================================

# index.php

Runs a test program and displays the resulting stack.
